## Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme manages projects with a customer-first approach, iterative delivery, and clear ownership. The core project management lifecycle includes:

1. **Initiation** – Define the problem, stakeholders, and desired outcomes.
2. **Planning** – Break work into increments, estimate, identify risks, and milestone mapping.
3. **Execution & Tracking** – Use structured boards, regular standups, demos, and QA checks.
4. **Release & Deployment** – Standardized steps for release readiness, deployment, verification, and rollback.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** – Capture action items and learnings for ongoing process evolution.
